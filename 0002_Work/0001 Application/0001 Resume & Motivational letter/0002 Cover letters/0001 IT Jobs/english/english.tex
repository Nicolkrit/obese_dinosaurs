Before working at Macroworks, I was a web development intern at Spin.io in Detroit, Michigan, where I was primarily responsible for fixing bugs, implementing UI enhancements, maintaining pages via WordPress, and using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build and enhance web pages. I also assisted in the development and rollout of a widget that helps cyclists locate their nearest bike lane, which is now one of Spin.io's most popular products.

\noindent
At both Macroworks and Spin.io I demonstrated my ability to hit deadlines, maintain strong attention to detail, and produce top-notch code. I'm confident my skills will be put to good use at [Company Name]. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
