###### ← position-verttab-gone.css

- this file originally removes the verticle tabs so that users can use sidebery/treestyletabs as the main tabs source, the original makes the sidebar autohide unless hovered.
- this modified version removes the autohiding of the sidebar, keeping the sidebar semi-static, still resizable, non-floating.
