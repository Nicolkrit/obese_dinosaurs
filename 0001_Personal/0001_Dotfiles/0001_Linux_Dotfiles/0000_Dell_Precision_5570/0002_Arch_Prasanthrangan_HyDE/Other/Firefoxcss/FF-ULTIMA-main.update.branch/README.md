## Installation

###### There are 2 ways to install this theme, both have their drawbacks and strengths. Choose one.

### The Easy Way, get it and go:

1. Download the latest version by [clicking here](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-ULTIMA/archive/refs/heads/main.update.branch.zip). Or on the [release page.](https://github.com/soulhotel/FF-CSS-ULTIMA/releases/latest)
2. Find your firefox profile folder by typing `about:support` in the URL BAR.
3. On the `about:support` page, youll see your profile folder in the blue table. Open it.

4. In that folder create a new folder named `chrome` (if you don't have the folder already).
5. In the zip `ffultimaX.X.X.zip`, copy the files from the `ffultimaX.X.X` folder into the chrome folder.
6. Inside the chrome folder is a file named `user.js`, copy and paste it into your Profile Folder.
7. For `user.js` to apply, restart Firefox. THEN, once FF is open, delete the `user.js` files.
8. `user.js` will let you change settings like tab size and autohiding from the about:config page.
